  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Hi — I’m <strong>Subhajit Sen</strong>, a B.Tech student and web developer. I build small tools and web apps that solve everyday problems for students and small businesses. QR Maker began as a student project and grew into a simple, privacy-first utility for generating reliable QR codes without any servers.</p>

  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <p>My goal is to make useful web tools that respect privacy and are free to use. QR Maker focuses on speed, safety, and simplicity so anyone can create QR codes quickly and download them for print or digital use.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have suggestions or want help integrating QR codes into your business, email: <strong>subhasen054@gmail.com</strong></p>
